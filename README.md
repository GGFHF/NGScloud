# NGScloud ()

    WARNING: Now NGScloud is deprecated. You must use NGScloud2, a major version of NGScloud,
    available at "https://github.com/GGFHF/NGScloud2/".

NGScloud is a bioinformatic system developed to analyze RNA-seq data using the cloud computing services
of Amazon that permit the access to ad hoc computating infrastructure scaled according to the complexity
of the experiment, so its costs and times can be optimized. The application provides a user-friendly
front-end to operate Amazon's hardware resources, and to control a workflow of RNA-seq analysis oriented
to non-model species, incorporating the cluster concept, which allows parallel runs of common RNA-seq
analysis programs in several virtual machines for faster analysis.

This software has been developed by:

    GI Genética, Fisiología e Historia Forestal
    Dpto. Sistemas y Recursos Naturales
    ETSI Montes, Forestal y del Medio Natural
    Universidad Politécnica de Madrid

Refer to the NGScloud-manual.pdf in the "Package" folder for installation
instructions, a description of the software and examples of use.
